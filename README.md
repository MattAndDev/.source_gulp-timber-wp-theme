# WP Timber starter theme with gulp

Includes the following tools, tasks, and workflows:

- Browserify (with browserify-shim)
- Watchify (caching version of browserify for super fast rebuilds)
- SASS (super fast libsass with source maps, and autoprefixer)
- BrowserSync for live reloading and a static server
- Image optimization
- Javascript linting
- ES2015 transpilation
- Error handling in the console and in Notification Center
- Shimming non common-js vendor code with other dependencies (like a jQuery plugin)
- Svg icon sprite generation using gulp-svg-sprite
- sass libs and utilities built by [Arillo](http://www.arillo.net)
- Separate code and template folders for wp

Based on:
- [gulp-starter](https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter) for gulp config and structure
- [gulp-plate](https://github.com/arillo/gulp-plate) for sass libs and structure
- [timber-starter-theme](https://github.com/Upstatement/timber-starter-theme) for wp timber theme

Thanks!
